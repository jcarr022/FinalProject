# FinalProject
Final SNP calling project for GEN@@)

Small problem: For some reason the tools dont like that the TAIR9 reference named the chromosomes by just number. The accessions use "Chr1, Chr2, ...". Also, the reference has the mitochondrial genome before the chloroplast, because...reasons, and the accessions have that flipped. To fix this, I went into the TAIR9.fa file and manually renamed the chromosomes and moved the cp and mt genomes around to make it fit.
